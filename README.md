Webapp-Boilerplate
==================

Simple boilerplate for small webapps.

This includes responsive design via [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) & [Compass](http://compass-style.org/). It also uses [Google Webfonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), but you can safely remove these libraries.

There is an [Apple Touch Icon](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html).

To build your app, this boilerplate is configured to use [jQuery 2.0.0](http://jquery.com/), but you may replace it with any other Javascript library (e.g. [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/)). You may also want to take a look at all the new [Javascript APIs](http://alistapart.com/article/environmental-design-with-the-device-api).

For deployment as an offline app a [cache manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTML/Using_the_application_cache) and a [Mozilla App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Manifest) has been added.

So all the cool stuff is here. :)

Setup
-----

1. Replace "Flashy title" in all files with the name of your app
2. Replace "Flashy description" in all files with the description of your app
3. Replace favicon.ico (48×48px),  favicon.png (128×128px) and apple-touch-icon.png (144×144px) with your icon
4. Start coding!
