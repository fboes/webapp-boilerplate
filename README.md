Webapp-Boilerplate
==================

Simple boilerplate for small webapps. This includes responsive design via [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) & [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), a [cache manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTML/Using_the_application_cache) and [jQuery 2.0.0](http://jquery.com/). It also has a [Apple Touch Icon](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html) and uses [Google Webfonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/). So all the cool stuff is here. :)
